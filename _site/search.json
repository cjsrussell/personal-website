    "text": "Making a codebook in Quarto\n\nWhat is Quarto?\nQuarto is great. It was made by the folks over at Posit (who make RStudio) and provides a singe ecosystem for your coding notebooks, websites, presentations, along with books and other documents.\nInstalling it is super easy and an installation guide can be found here. I’ll be using RStudio for this example but all of this can also be done using other tools (i made my codebook for my current project in VS Code) and these are also covered in the above link.\n\n\nSetting up a Quarto book\nTo get started we will need to create a project. If you have not used projects before they are a nice tidy way to keep related files collected together in their own directory.\nWe will use the Quarto Book format and to create one you go to:\nFile -&gt; New Project… -&gt; New Diectory -&gt; Quarto Book\nYou can then choose the folder name for your directory, and where you want it to be stored. If you use renv and/or git you can tick those options, but they’re not needed to make it work.\n\nThis will create your project and generate some files for you:\n_quarto.yml - this is the main settings and contents page for your codebook.\nindex.qmd - this and the other .qmd files are the different pages of your codebook\nreferences.bib is the bibliography file for any references you might want to include.\nWe already have everything we need to to make our book! We will make one quick change here and then you can now see what this looks like without any further input.\nin _quarto.yml we will update the format section to include word document, so it should look like this (without my comments):\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n  pdf:\n    documentclass: scrreprt\n  docx:                          # this adds .docx output format\n   toc: true                     # this enables table of contents\n   number-sections: true         # this enables section numbering\n\nWe can now see what this document and a PDF would look like! You can do this by clicking the dropdown in RStudio:\n\nor by running the following in the terminal (not the R console, the other tab!). This will create a _book folder in your directory in which you can see PDF and a .doc file of your book:\n\nquarto render\n\nand we can preview the web version would look like by running the following:\n\nquarto preview\n\nYou can choose whether it renders the website in the RStudio viewer pane, or an external window (e.g. browser). To do this just click ther cog icon:\n\n\n\nWhat’s going in our codebook?\nAt the very minimum a codebook should have the following:"
