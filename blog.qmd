Recently at conferences and in meetings I have been asked about how I made some of the resources we have for our Explaining Atheism project. I decided the quickest way to share this would be to write a couple of blogs. I might expand this and add some ramblings on random topics to the mix, but for now this blog will have tutorials for some of the tools I use that I think might be helpful for others :)
